In an innovative business competition in college in 2004, I designed and programmed the karaoke monster and won first prize amongst students.

It's old school crap code with a hilarious ASP and MSACCESS database, but maybe someone will take the idea and build a more modern app out of syncing lyrics.  Feel free to use the branding or anything out of it.

Sadly we lost the recording of the live event because I was a nice guy and recorded someone else's presentation.
